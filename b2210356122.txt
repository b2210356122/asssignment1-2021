I am a computer science student at Hacettepe University.I like to paint and consume content about art. In fact, almost all visual arts interest me.As I followed the political and social issues during the quarantine period, I realized that they caught my attention. Now I like to read and watch about these subjects.
I acknowledge that i have fully read and understood the contents of the course website; I will not share my work (not even a part of it) on Piazza; I will be responsible for what has been discussed/asked on Piazza; I will not expect any response for my questions that have already been asked or written in a language other than English. I understand that if I have any questions or concerns about the course mechanics, it is my responsibility to discuss them with the instructors within their office hours.
